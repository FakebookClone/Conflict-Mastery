    <p>Step 1 - Pull from Master Branch to get any updates</p>
    <p>Step 2 - Create a new branch to start working on a single feature</p>
    <p>Step 3 - Work on your feature on the new branch and then add to staging area after you're finsihed</p>
    <p>Step 4 - Then in the console do a git add . to stage the repo.</p>
    <p>Step 5 - Git commit -m "detailed message here"</p>
    <p>Step 6 - Git checkout master</p>
    <p>Step 7 - git pull ("fast-forward" means no conflicts)</p>
    <p>Step 8 - git checkout branchname</p>
    <p>Step 9 - git merge master (this will merge master into your branch)</p>
    <p>Step 10 - git log (if needed. It shows recent commits)</p>
    <p>Step 11 - NEVER git push origin master. We don't work off master!</p>
    <p>Step 12 - git push origin branchname (If you git push origin ranchname -u, you can simply git push in the future for that branch</p>
    <p>Step 13 - if there are merge conflicts, you need a special git commit after resolving them.</p>
    <p>Step 14 - git push branchname</p>
    <p>make a pull request</p>
    <p>after pull request merged to master, you'll delete your branch</p>
